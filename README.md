<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there</p>

<p>I am a backend, platform, and devOps engineer experienced in building high-performant, fast-scaling, and reliable external and internal eCommerce software, including cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring and alerting systems, and automated test suites.</p>

<p> This is my personal GitHub, which spans my very first software projects and random musings and practice work I do when learning a new language.
