<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Dr. Lisa M. Stedman-Falls.</p>
<p> For the past 10 years, I have led a successful career as a behavioral scientist, clinician, educator, organizational leader, and consultant.</p>
<p> I have always been passionate about the use of technology, and I have recently decided to pursue that passion more fully. I am now transitioning from my career in behavioral science to a career in software engineering, and I am continuing to expand my programming repertoire through an intensive software development bootcamp. I look forward to exploring new opportunities within the technology sector, and continuing to learn and grow.
