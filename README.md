HiðŸ‘‹ I'm Lisa, a Platform, Infrastructure, and Software Engineer.

I help build production-quality internal tools and automated systems, frictionless and robust CI/CD pipelines, scalable and reliable cloud infrastructure, and intuitive self-service platforms. 

This is my personal Github account that I mainly use for getting familiar with new stacks.
