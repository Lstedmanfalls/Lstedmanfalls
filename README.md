<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Dr. Lisa M. Stedman-Falls.</p>
<p> Over the past 10 years, I have led a career as a behavioral scientist, practitioner, organizational leader, and consultant. My main areas of specialization have been in technology-based behavioral assessment, treatment, and staff training (through robotic simulated clients, eHealth apps and devices, web-based platforms, and telehealth). I have published four research studies, primarily exploring the use of technology to advance Applied Behavior Analysis.</p>

<p> I am currently transitioning my career to software development, and I am continuing to expand my programming repertoire through an intensive software development bootcamp.</p>
<p> I look forward to exploring new opportunities within the technology sector, and continuing to learn and grow.</p>
