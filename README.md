<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Lisa Stedman-Falls.</p>
<p> I am a Ph.D.-level behavioral scientist, turned full stack developer ðŸ¤“</p>

<p>My areas of greatest strength are in Python/Django, learning/training, research, and data analysis.</p>
<p> Prior to transitioning to software development, I specialized in technology-based behavioral assessment, treatment, and staff training. I've co-published 4 studies, including the use of humanoid robots, eHealth apps, wireless monitoring devices, and other technologies, to help advance behavioral science and practice.</p>

<p>I've always loved working with tech, and Iâ€™m stoked to be on the other side of it now!</p>
