<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there. 

I am a software engineer with niches in platform engineering and devOps, experienced in building high-performant, fast-scaling, external and internal software and AWS cloud infrastructure: REST APIs, ETL pipelines, CI/CD workflows, databases, monitoring and alerting, automated testing, container orchestration.</p>

<p> This is my personal GitHub full of random things.
