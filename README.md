HiðŸ‘‹ I'm Lisa, a Platform, Infrastructure, and Software Engineer.

I help build production-quality internal tools and automated systems, frictionless and robust CI/CD pipelines, scalable and reliable cloud infrastructure, and intuitive self-service platforms. 

This is my personal Github account that I previously used just for getting familiar with new stacks, and take-home assignments.

I have now also begun building mindbuttergold, which is an open source, community-driven software project with a vision of helping modern best practices become standard practice, across the software industry at large. The mission is to make best practices tangible and accessible by housing production-quality, working demonstrations of software and infrastructure that the community can learn from, enhance, and use.
